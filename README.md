# Hyperion v1.0
Welcome to Hyperion, Roblox's newest executor.<br>Level 3 (so far)<br>~30% UNC.<br>Monaco Editor<br>Work In Progress
## File API
Hyperion comes with it's own File API developed by me.<br>Missing support for loadfile, because loadstring is incomplete at this moment.<br>It has all File functions (besides loadfile) and All Folder functions.<br>Better than some Executors.
## Console API
Hyperion comes with a Unique Console API, where it makes a Console window ðŸŽ‰ðŸŽ‰ðŸŽ‰<br>You can write, get, and close the console.
## Other API's
### loadstring
Kinda working, it executes the scripts. Not fully done yet.
## Injector
Using NX for now..
